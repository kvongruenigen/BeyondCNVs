# Beyond CNVs - Exploring compound mutational hits in reference datasets
### Master project in development
Genomic copy number variations (CNV) are a major contributor to the mutation load in cancer. 
The generation of reference cancer CNV datasets and large-scale CNV data analyses constitute a focus of the Theoretical Cytogenetics and Oncogenomics group. 
Such analyses are complementary to studies focussing on sequence modifications (e.g. SNVs) detected through NGS techniques.

The study will generate compound variant data through integration of the [Progenetix]<https://www.progenetix.org "Progenetix Homepage"> reference CNV data with SNVs from external datasets, most notably from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; ~11k samples with -omics data), 
cancer cell lines (cancercelllines.org) and data portals such as cBioPortal.

__Expected outcomes:__

* Comprehensive integration of non-CNV genomic variation data with Progenetix
* Creation of a GA4GH Beacon w/ deep representation of TCGA (and cell line) data
* Development of Beacon queries and representation for compound genomic variations
* Analysis of compound or alternative variant events in the TCGA dataset and beyond
